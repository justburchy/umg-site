    <h1>The OCU Framework™</h1>
    <p>The mindset for<i> sustainable change.</i></p>
    <br/></br>
    <h2>What is The OCU Framework?</h2>
    <p>The OCU Framework is a simple, human-centered model for navigating real change at work, in teams, and in life.</p>
    <p>Built around three repeatable steps—<b>Organize, Challenge, Uplift</b>—OCU offers a practical and emotionally intelligent way to create clarity, surface tension, and move forward with grounded momentum.</p>
    <p> It works because it’s not about control.</p>
    <p>It’s about capacity, connection, and conscious direction.</p>
    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <p>Unlike most models, OCU was designed for real humans, not just high-performers or change enthusiasts. It:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourages emotionally intelligent leadership</li>
        <li>Integrates inclusion and trust into every phase, quietly but deeply</li>
        <li>Supports neurodiverse thinkers through clarity and pattern</li>
        <li>Requires no jargon, no certification, no corporate theater</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>How It's Used</h2>
    <p>OCU is intentionally flexible enough to guide: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team retreats and strategy workshops</li>
        <li>Change communications and rollouts</li>
        <li>Personal reflection and coaching</li>
        <li>Organizational transformation</li>
      </ul>
    <p>It’s being used by leaders, facilitators, and practitioners who want change to feel <b>more possible, more honest, and more human.</b></p>
